Make two integer variables with the values `15` and `-102` and two double variables with the values `12.56` and `-45.87`.

Using the variables, do the following:
- Print the result of the question "is 15 less than 12.56?"
- Print the result of the question "is -102 the same as -45.87?"
- Print the result of the question "is 12.56 different from 12.56?"
- Print the result of the question "is -102 greater than or equal to -45.87?"
- Print the result of the question "is 15 greater than -45.87?"
- Print the result of the question "is 12.56 less than or equal to -102?"

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.

# You Do

Create four whole number variables (`var1`, `var2`, `var3`, `var4`) that are each assigned a random whole number from -100 to 100.

Perform the following comparisons using the variables and print the results:
- 1 greater than 2
- 2 less than 3
- 3 equal to 4
- 4 not equal to 1
- 1 greater than or equal to 3
- 2 less than or equal to 4

Can you ever run the program to get all `true` responses or all `false` responses?

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
